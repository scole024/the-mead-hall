Downloaded images of the public Tableau dashboards I created/managed during my time at USAID Data Services.

**Digital Ecosystem Country Assessment (DECA) Dashboard:** I created the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning tab, which monitored selected indicators of digital growth across countries with available data. I created a graph comparing the indicators between base years and available years selected by the user. Countries receiving USAID assistance are marked, and countries by region are highlighted by color.
