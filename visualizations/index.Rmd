## Public Visualizations

### Work for [SelectUSA](https://www.trade.gov/selectusa):

My Tableau journey started when I worked at SelectUSA (January 2020 to June 2022). One of my first projects was creating public interactive data visualizations on foreign direct investment (FDI) into the United States at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. Additionally, in Fall 2020, I	was able to show them off when I managed and created a webinar series on SelectUSA statistical dashboards for the State International Development Organizations, Inc. (SIDO) - and I got to (virtually) see some of my former [Maine International Trade Center](https://www.mitc.com/) coworkers in the webinars as well!

### Personal: 

If you haven't checked it out yet, I started a new blog, [The Mead Hall](https://themeadhall.substack.com/), over on Substack in which I discuss data and culture. I've been experimenting with both static and interactive dashboards, and I present two interactive dashboards below (with more context in my blog):

In addition to the visualizations in the Mead Hall, I created a personal public Tableau dashboard in summer 2024. Some friends convinced me to watch the *Tour de France: Unchained* Netflix series in June 2024, which got me subsequently obsessed enough to follow the 2024 Tour de France. But when I realized there was so much more that I didn't know, I decided to create a dashboard for a new watcher such as myself to follow along.

After some constructive feedback, I created an updated dashboard with stage win information as well.

## Look upon my (USAID) works, ye Mighty, and despair!

### For these are no longer funded.

During my time as an Economist for USAID Data Services (July 2022 to February 2025), I was responsible for two public dashboards, which were publicly available until February 2025. In addition to these dashboards, I was responsible for creating and maintaining internal dashboards for the USAID Data Services Training Team and the USAID Mission in Zimbabwe, among other ad hoc visualizations I was responsible for. The following are downloaded images of the dashboards before they were removed.

**Evaluation Registry Dashboard:** *January 2025* I managed the FY2023 update of the Evaluation Registry Dashboard, which provided an easy way to access and analyze USAID evaluations by country, sector, year, and type of evaluation (impact or performance).

Country View, including a view of the Evaluation Abstract highlighted when hovering over each evaluation. I managed the FY23 manual creation of these abstracts.

**Digital Ecosystem Country Assessment (DECA) Dashboard:** *January 2023* I created the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning tab, which monitored selected indicators of digital growth across countries with available data. I created a graph comparing the indicators between base years and available years selected by the user. Countries receiving USAID assistance are marked, and countries by region are highlighted by color. I have included select indicator visualizations. And if you haven't dealt with sheet swapping and parameter locations, I hope you lead a blessed life and never do!
