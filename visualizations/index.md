Visualizations

## Public Visualizations

### Work for [SelectUSA](https://www.trade.gov/selectusa):

My Tableau journey started when I worked at SelectUSA (January 2020 to
June 2022). One of my first projects was creating public interactive
data visualizations on foreign direct investment (FDI) into the United
States at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level from Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) data. Additionally, in Fall 2020, I was able to
show them off when I managed and created a webinar series on SelectUSA
statistical dashboards for the State International Development
Organizations, Inc. (SIDO) - and I got to (virtually) see some of my
former [Maine International Trade Center](https://www.mitc.com/)
coworkers in the webinars as well!

### Personal:

So far I’ve only created one personal public Tableau dashboard. Some
friends convinced me to watch the *Tour de France: Unchained* Netflix
series in June 2024, which got me subsequently obsessed enough to follow
the 2024 Tour de France. But when I realized there was so much more that
I didn’t know, I decided to create a dashboard for a new watcher such as
myself to follow along.

## Look upon my works, ye Mighty, and despair!

### For the USAID ones are no longer funded.

During my time as an Economist for USAID Data Services (July 2022 to
February 2025), I was responsible for two public dashboards, which were
publicly available until February 2025. In addition to these dashboards,
I was responsible for creating and maintaining internal dashboards for
the USAID Data Services Training Team and the USAID Mission in Zimbabwe.
The following are downloaded images of the dashboards before they were
removed.

**Evaluation Registry Dashboard:** *January 2025* I managed the FY2023
update of the Evaluation Registry Dashboard, which provided an easy way
to access and analyze USAID evaluations by country, sector, year, and
type of evaluation (impact or performance).

when hovering over each evaluation. I managed the FY23 manual creation
of these abstracts. ![ER Country View](ER%20Country%20View.png) ![ER

**Digital Ecosystem Country Assessment (DECA) Dashboard:** *January
2023* I created the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning tab, which
monitored selected indicators of digital growth across countries with
available data. I created a graph comparing the indicators between base
years and available years selected by the user. Countries receiving
USAID assistance are marked, and countries by region are highlighted by
color.
